There are many different philosophies, here.  From western medicine, to "traditional" medicine, and all things in between.

The point of medicine, and the focus of this section, is to fix in our bodies, that which breaks.  "Western" medical science looks at an effect (symptom), often treats the symptom, and then looks for a possible cause of the symptom and treats that cause.

Other medical philosophies believe there is a connection between the mind and sould and the body, and provides a more holistic treatment of a symptom, and often includes preventive practices.

It is important to note that, western medical systems generally do not support non-western treatments for valid, western reasons.  If you live in a western society, do not risk your ready access to western medical treatment.  Also, western medicine is designed around the ideology of due process.  This means that a treatment isn't considered suitable until it has gone trough a stringent research, study, evaluation, and testing phase and becomes authorized by the medical society and/or government.  Self diagnosis and treatment is strongly frowned upon and is considered extremely dangerous.
