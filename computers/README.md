Computers
=========

Generally, computers are a specific, but general purpose electronic, programable device.  That is, we understand that our desktop computer and our laptop, are computers.  But some may also understand that a smart phone, or certain smart devices, are also computers, but they are generally more specific purpose, or limited purpose.

For the purpose of the Open Information project, the most appropriate path hierarchy is to have the computer section as a subset of the electronics path.
