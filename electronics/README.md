Generally speaking, electronics is quite simple, as much as it is about the flow of electricity along a conductor, most often a wire.

In its simple form, it means one can send electricity to a component which serves a function, such as a resistence filament, which heats up to produce...  well, heat...  and also light.

As components get more complex, electrically, things get much more difficult.  Some sub sections will likely deal with much more complex subjects, such as integrated circuits and computers.
