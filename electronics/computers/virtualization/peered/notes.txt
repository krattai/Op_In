- started off with a base installation of 32 bit ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS in virtualbox
- 192MB RAM with 2GB drive
- no updates
- ssh, samba and mdns installed as well as gogoc, which has now been shut down
- may want to run bind, although for sure should use OpenNIC, and if bind used, mirror opennic
- should run IPv6 natively and possibly only, while operating 6to4 until unnecessary
- according to current info and attempt in virtualbox, kvm not possible:
-- egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo returns 0

20170202
- openstack should still work without kvm, just simply won't run virtualized
- can run virtualized using different virtual machine configuration, such as virtualbox

20170203
- seem to be getting somewhere with devstack

- when using devstack example from:
  http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/
  or
  http://therandomsecurityguy.com/openstack-20-minutes/
  create user, of course, with permissions, then be sure to log into stack user and run everything from there

20170204
- devstack install appears to work better with 2GB of RAM on a VM

20170205
- Ubuntu 14.04 MAAS server installed and functional out of box on 1.6GB RAM vbox
- - Needed to set /etc/network/interfaces for eth1 (second NIC) auto/dhcp
