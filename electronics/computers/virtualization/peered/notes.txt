- started off with a base installation of 32 bit ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS in virtualbox
- 192MB RAM with 2GB drive
- no updates
- ssh, samba and mdns installed as well as gogoc, which has now been shut down
- may want to run bind, although for sure should use OpenNIC, and if bind used, mirror opennic
- should run IPv6 natively and possibly only, while operating 6to4 until unnecessary
