20170307 - working on developing a proof of concept autonomous, public network

20170308 - found dn42 which is likely a good framework, or basis for next steps : https://dn42.net/Home

20170309 - a ptp vpn needs to be created between peers.  openvpn static is good solution:
           https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html

20170311 - Check openvpn to utilzie IPv6 and possibly function as 6to4

20170313 - VPN appears to be working as defined (for later discussion)
           Need to determine BGP routing (likely using DN42 config, if already created)
           BGP by way of Bird, OpenBGPd, or Quagga
