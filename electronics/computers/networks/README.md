Networks
========

The reason for this sub project is to help people understand networks as well as develop skills and tools revolving around enabling people to set up functional and resiliant networks, including alternative methods and protocols, such as alt-DNS.

Networks have 7 layers, from hardware physical layer up to many different software layers.

Because networking is so vast, it deserves it's own directory.  There will likely be some crossover of information, but hopefully there will not be too much duplication.

Wikipedia shows the 7 OSI layers of a network:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model

Host Layers
7. Application - High-level APIs, including resource sharing, remote file access, directory services and virtual terminals - DotNetFtpLibrary, SMTP web API, SSH.NET, SnmpSharpNet, HTML Class, HTTP API server

6. Presentation - Translation of data between a networking service and an application; including character encoding, data compression and encryption/decryption - CSS, GIF, HTML, XML, JSON, S/MIME

5. Session - Managing communication sessions, i.e. continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back-and-forth transmissions between two nodes - RPC, SCP, NFS, PAP, TLS, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, SSH, Telnet

4. Transport - Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP) 	Reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement and multiplexing - NBF, TCP, UDP

Media layers
3. Network - Packet - Structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing, routing and traffic control - AppleTalk, ICMP, IPsec, IPv4, IPv6

2. Data link - Frame - Reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer - IEEE 802.2, L2TP, LLDP, MAC, PPP, ATM, MPLS

1. Physical - Bit - Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium 	DOCSIS, DSL, Ethernet physical layer, ISDN, USB
