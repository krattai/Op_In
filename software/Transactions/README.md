Transactions
============

This directory has been vaguely named, but it is intended to contain software and/or references for the capacity to conduct transactions between people.  There will likely be a commmunications directory created which will contain similarly functioning software, whereas the software here would be more related to commerce like transactions, whether that is accounting for time banking, trade dollars, or other types of local currencies and conversions of such transactions.

The work currently being done on this software is located in the noo-ebs project:
