pure DIY
========

This pure DIY folder is for energy that can be obtained without the need for any commercially acquired equipment.

It does not mean that a pure DIY project can not use *recycled* or *reclaimed* items, such as a barrel or bricks or piece of electronics (for example), although ultimately projects here **should** eventually be able to be created from scratch, depending on one's ability and resources to do so.

These pure DIY energy systems may be simple energy collection systems, such as solar thermal energy collection or gasification, where both can be developed with simple, raw, naturally occuring elements.
