Open(source) Energy Project
===========================

The Open Energy Project has been created to encourage and support the development of publicly useful and useable energy systems which are not encumbered by proprietary constraints.

This project is NOT focused specifically on fringe science energy technologies, although those technologies are not excluded from this project.

This project is NOT focused on any specific energy source, rather could include any known or unknown energy source which can be used directly or indirectly for useful energy systems.

This project IS focused on energy systems and sources which could be useable by an individual and / or household, and / or which could be scaled up or down, depending on the user's need.

It should be made perfectly clear that this project will not discourage any attempts at creating or utilizing a potential, theoretical or otherwise, energy source.  Further, this project will not discourage attempts to utilize energy sources which do not obtain some specific level of efficiency or output, as those are quite likely technical challenges that can be addressed and improved upon, or are irrelevant to the intention of this project's mandate.

This project began on Nov. 1, 2014.

Why the BSD license?

The intention of this project is to have all content be public domain, as it technically should be and the knowledge included is an inalienable human right.  But due to global, legal concern or interest, most knowledge is considered "Intellectual Property" and therefore, while public domain is a legal construct, claim against such knowledge could be brought about and the BSD license therefore covers any prior work instruments.  Yet, the BSD license also allows all rights to use any such knowledge for any purpose, so does not constrain future use of such knowledge, providing complete freedom to the included knowledge, as it can be covered.
