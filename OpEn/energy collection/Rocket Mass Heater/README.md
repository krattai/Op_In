A Rocket Mass Heater is technically an energy converter, taking energy from wood/biomatter and converting it to radiant and convected heat.  That said, this specific conversion does take the energy and collect it (store it) in a mass (stone, water, metal, etc) which then slowly dissipates that energy into the surrounding air, so in that sense, it is an energy converter AND collector.
