A Tesla Turbine may appear to be a questionable energy collection system as it requires pressurized airflow to run the turbine.

This is one of those systems where the application's context is important.  Rather than creating the pressurized air via traditional, or logical methods (such as an air compressor) in order to run the turbine, one would want to use the turbine in an application where airflow is already being generated, such as the exhaust of a combustion engine.

Alternatively, when generating heat via some other method, such as from a fire, part of, or all of, the convected heat could be used to charge a pressure vessel, which could then be used to run the Tesla Turbine.

There are certainly other applications where a Tesla Turbine could be used to collect energy.
