Pond Heater
===========

This is an "*instructables*" document on collecting heat from a chimney for heating pond water.

**NB**: It is very important to note there are certain risks associated with collecting heat from a chimney.  As noted in the instructables document, dropping the temperature in a chimney can create excessive creosote which could then be a fire hazard.

Carefully monitoring the flue temperature or collecting the heat from a chimney only when it is piped outside of a building structure could resolve this concern and hazard.
