Compost Heating System
======================

This is an "*instructables*" document on creating Compost Heating System using a Pain Mound.

Like other energy collection systems, this system assumes that a person has wood chips and sawdust available from some other process, rather than creating the wood chips and sawdust specifically for this system, which could be less efficient than other methods of utilizing wood for energy collection.

It may be possible to use other biomass in the compost pile with varying results, but any compost pile *does* generate heat which could be collected.
