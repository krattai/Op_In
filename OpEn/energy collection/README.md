Energy Collection
=================

This energy collection is for the collection of energy which may require equipment or materials that may need to be commercially acquired.

These pieces of equipment or materials may use *recycled* or *reclaimed* items, such as a barrel or bricks or piece of electronics (for example), or may require new materials or equipment which cannot be, or would be extremely difficult to make, without prior, advanced tools or processes being available.
