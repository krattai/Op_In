Energy Storage
==============

This energy storage directory is for the storage of energy which may require equipment or materials that may need to be commercially acquired.

These pieces of equipment or materials may use *recycled* or *reclaimed* items, such as a barrel or bricks or piece of electronics (for example), or may require new materials or equipment which cannot be, or would be extremely difficult to make, without prior, advanced tools or processes being available.

Typically, energy storage is represented by a battery which stores electricity.  In reality, all potential energy is stored until it is released, such as the Sun which stores a vast amount of potential energy, which is being released continuously and will continue to do so, like an electrical battery, until it runs out.  Gasoline or diesel is potential energy and the energy storage container is a tank that holds the potential energy until it is transfered to a combustion device which enables the release and conversion of that energy.

Batteries, or energy storage devices, can also include compression, elevation / gravity, thermal, flywheels, etc., and not just electricity.
