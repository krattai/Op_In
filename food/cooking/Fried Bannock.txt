Fried Bannock


    3 cups sifted flour
    1 teaspoon salt
    2 tablespoons baking powder
    water
    vegetable oil or lard


Mix half the flour with the remaining dry ingredients.
Add water until the mixture becomes thick, "like a paper mache paste".
Add more flour until the dough feels like a soft earlobe.
Heat the oil or lard over a medium-high heat until very hot, but not smoking.
Break off small pieces of the dough and flatten each to the size of your palm, about 1/2-inch thick.
Place the pieces in the hot oil, turn after about 3 minutes, or when golden brown.
Place the bannock on a paper towel to soak up the excess grease.
Serve plain or with jam.
