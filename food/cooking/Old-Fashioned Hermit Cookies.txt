Old-Fashioned Hermit Cookies

1/4 cup vegetable shortening
1/4 cup butter (softened)
1 cup brown sugar (firmly packed)
1 large egg
1/4 cup coffee (cold)
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, 8 ounces
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Optional: dash ground cloves
 \> if you do not have ground cloves, you can crush 2 whole cloves and infuse them in hot coffee and let cool
  \>> strain out cloves before adding infused coffee to ingredients
1 1/2 cups chopped dates (or raisins)
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (or pecans) 

    Heat the oven to 375 F.
    Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.
    Measure the flour, baking soda, salt, and spices into a bowl. Mix well and set aside.
    In a mixing bowl with electric mixer, beat the shortening, butter, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and cold coffee; beat on low speed until well blended.
    Add the flour mixture and stir until well combined.
    Fold in the dates or raisins and nuts.

    Drop the cookie dough by rounded teaspoon or small cookie scoop onto the prepared cookie sheet, leaving about 2 inches between cookies.
    Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes.
    Remove the cookies immediately to a cooling rack.

Makes about 4 dozen cookies.
