Metis Bannock


    3 cups all-purpose flour (or whole wheat flour)
    2 tablespoons baking powder
    1 tablespoon sugar
    1⁄2 teaspoon salt
    1⁄2 cup margarine (or butter or shortening)
    3⁄4-1 cup milk (or water)

optional: 1 egg

Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.
Work in the margarine using hands until you make a nice crumble. If you have Olivina margarine in your area, I find this makes for the best bannock.
Add egg at this time if desired
Gradually mix in enough milk to make soft but not sticky. Knead.
Shape into a ball, place on a greased baking sheet, then flatten into a circle about 1 inch thick.
Bake at 425°F (220°C) for 25 minutes or until lightly browned.
