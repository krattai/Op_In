Nutrition

    1 cup creamy peanut butter
    1 cup packed brown sugar
    1 cup white sugar
    1 cup butter or 1 cup margarine, softened
    2 eggs
    1 teaspoon baking soda
    1 teaspoon baking powder
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    2 1‚ÅÑ2 cups flour

Directions

    Cream butter, peanut butter and both sugars together.
    Add eggs, one at a time, beating well.
    Add baking soda, powder and vanilla.
    Stir in flour.
    Roll into balls, roll in sugar. Flatten cookies, using a fork, in a criss-cross pattern.
    Bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 6-7 minutes or adjust to suit your oven and size of cookies!

 I also tried adding a tiny sprinkle of coarse salt to the top of the cookie just before baking, which was a nice twist.

 baked mine at 325 for 12 min. They came out perfect. They didn't get hard at all. They are light and crispy.

added roughly a cup of mini chocolate chips 

added cinnamon sugar to the rolling sugar for a little extra bite.

1 Tbsp cinnamon

Maple flavoring

After substituting one of the eggs for 1/4 cup vegetable oil, it made them really soft and stay really soft.
