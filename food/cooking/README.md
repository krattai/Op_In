Cooking
=======

Cooking is a generic term in this context.  Not all food needs to be cooked.

At this time, cooking will likely include preparing, cooking, and preserving all manner of foods.

It's funny how people view the products we buy as immutable. Often in the same way we view the sticker price of an item. There is always an opportunity to negotiate the price and there's always an opportunity to adjust the look, feel and taste of the things we buy.

In the restaurant business, a cook will often take an industry product and adjust it. For example, buy a brand of mustard, then add pickle juice, sugar, and other flavourings and spices to taste. We can do the same in our personal kitchens. It might be a bit of work, but often well worth it.
