This document is starting as a simple idea, but needs to be expanded upon.

The executive summary of this document is that, while there is a certain, pointed expression of hate on for industrialized agriculture / food production, it is very important to note that our current form of agriculture is extremely efficient.

As people look to bring food production back to their urban yards, these efficiencies disappear.

For this reason, and for sustainability, energy conscious, and health concerns, using petroleum fertilizer and pesticides, individualized tools, especially in powered tools, these things add to not just our costs.

Effective and efficient use of soil, water, nutrients, and recycling of organic material becomes much more important and should be a part of localized and urban food production.
