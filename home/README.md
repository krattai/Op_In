We all need shelter.  We call our long term shelter that we hang our hats and sleep at night, our home.  Having a home includes having materials to put the structure up and also maintaining that structure during its effective life span.

This folder includes information on everything from building a home, but to add on to an existing structure, modify a structure, and maintain a structure.

The information in this directory should be in some form of open or public license.  Some information may contain information that might be construed as trade secrets and / or be presented by or include commercial advertisement interest.  The goal is to ensure that all information is otherwise free to use for both personal and commercial purposes and allow for the opportunity to use that information without commercial products, or at least with alternative commercial and non-commercial products and services.
