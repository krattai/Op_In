Education
=========

The Open Information project contains a lot of informmation that is oriented towards helping others learn how to help themselves and their communities.  In that sense, the entire project is about education.

This specific directory is focused specifically on education.  Not the material to teach, but rather the tools to gather material for training and helping those who wish to learn.  This would also include things like providing tools for tutors.
