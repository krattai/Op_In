ISSOCAA - Interdisciplinary Seminar Series On Community And Abundance

So a friend of mine posted an article with a podcast on scarcity which I found quite interesting.  I'm not sure how I want to work it into a (or the) theme.

My "Building Communities" workshop was going to need a follow up, regardless.  With that said, I'm thinking that I am going to put an emphasis on "Abundant Societies".  I suspect that I'm strongly leaning towards and will likely work on an Abundant Societies series, with Building Communities as being the first within the series.


Mashed fb communication on development of concept and integration into the BANG community:

This is an amazing episode that I have encouraged others to listen to. It offers explanation for many of today's drivers... Scarcity...

Kevin Rattai This has long been a fundamentally problematic artifact of our "modern" societies. It deals with our "lizard" brain's fear response. It is used directly in marketing and sales along with a similar tool called "take away".

This is one of the most difficult challenges for a human to overcome.

Kevin Rattai Thanks for sharing this podcast. [redacted]. It dealt with a lot of scenarios and it's a very "complex" problem insofar as we actually need to shift our paradigm about the idea of scarcity, not as something to know and manage, but as something that is inaccurate. And that's not something that can be explained in short order as one needs to deconstruct our old thinking.

Listening to the podcast has inspired me to either create a supplemental "Abundant societies" workshops to supplement my "Building communities" workshop or perhaps I'll use it as an overarching theme for a longer series of workshops...

I will have to work that out. üòé

On that note, I wonder if this idea could somehow be a frame for BANG?

Do you have more context regarding these?

I'm working on it.  This is only a 5 minute old concept.  üòÄ

I'm not sure, but I'm starting to like the monthly workshop concept until we grow larger.

If we do have the mystery workshop, getting people to try something new & exciting, then we don't need workshops as often with the fear that people will pick & choose.

In this case, where we only have 12 workshops a year, i'm wondering how a series would fit into this?

Is an abundant society where, even if we all fall flat on our face & lose everything, we're still at least guaranteed food on the table and a fresh start, while in a scarce society, we would be dead?

I only received two responses to my email to the community regarding feedback, but I have a feeling that at the very least, our 4 hour Saturday workshop could end up being a keystone.

Keep in mind that I'm only putting this out there as something for the medium to long term future, but we can eventually have a weekday, 1 hour workshop with 1 hour networking once or twice a month, with our "regular" weekend workshop for the more "meaty" community value.

I uploaded the podcast to our shared drive.  It's light on solutions, but presents the problem fairly well in a half an hour:

The ideology of abundance is one of those "we're doing it wrong" concepts.  You stated the following above "... still at least guaranteed..." and that's a scarcity way of thinking.  Not wrong on you, that's the way our society is conditioned to think.

Nature does not withhold food from anyone.  It is people that do that, whether by controlling the resource or controlling the means of production.  If a person could simply step out of their shelter and grab the food that is within 200 feet of their doorway, there would be no food scarcity.  Instead, we have rules about where gardens can be or suggesting some safety factor or we pave over our food resources justified as cleanliness or efficiencies and we're also bombarded with characterizations of desirability.

It is a complete societal, global paradigm shift that needs to occur in order to move to an abundance society.  But it can be done community by community, tribe by tribe.
