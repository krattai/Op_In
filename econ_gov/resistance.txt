Resistance and acceptance of alternative economics and currency

We live in a world where the current form of economics and currency has been around for over 150 years.  It has been suggested that human memory lasts approximately three generations and it can take about 7 generations for a behaviour to be set in a culture.  On that basis, our economics and currencies are entrenched within our cultures and ingrained into our behaviours.  Changing how we think of economics and currency is extremely challenging and wrot with comments such as "why change if it's working?"

That begs the question, though.  Is it working?
