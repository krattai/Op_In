Resistance and acceptance of alternative economics and currency
===============================================================

We live in a world where the current form of economics and currency has been around for over 150 years.  It has been suggested that human memory lasts approximately three generations and it can take about 7 generations for a behaviour to be set in a culture.  On that basis, our economics and currencies are entrenched within our cultures and ingrained into our behaviours.  Changing how we think of economics and currency is extremely challenging and wrot with comments such as "why change if it's working?"

That begs the question, though.  Is it working?

Without getting too deep into the topic, economics is a description of the distribution of wealth.  Wealth, in our current cultural understanding, is defined or described as the accumulation of possessions or money.  And the accumulation of wealth is a driving force of our current cultures.

Why is it that we crave wealth?  What does wealth give us?

It could be suggested that wealth is our perception of security.  That security can come in many forms, including our ability to put clothes on our backs, a roof over our head, a table in our home, and food on the table.  It can also be our perception of power, which can allow us to believe other physical aspects of our lives become available to us, including our relationships with others, our ability to find a significant other, and perhaps, eventually, to create a family.

How would our behaviours change, or would they, if our we felt our security was ensured?  If we were certain that we would be accomodated with things that our lives would be filled with abundance of our needs, would economics and currency have any further value?

Perhaps these things wouldn't have a value, but at this point in society, most people do not have the luxery to consider these things.  The risk is too great.  We live in fear that our needs will not be met and therefore wealth is of the utmost concern, above all other things.  For without wealth, how would we acquire food, clothes, a house and table, and relationships?

While some, with the spare time, interest, and desire look towards a more utopian world and may work on ideas and theories towards that end, others do not feel it is important.  These others feel that what we have is good enough, at least in the sense that they can figure out how to make ends meet and still build and maintain their desired relationships and social status.

The risk of alternatives is how they may effect our status quo.  And further to that risk may be that some alternatives may simply be a ruse by certain people who still believe in the accumulation of wealth, and therefore are simply attempting to reframe economics and currency towards their own benefit, resulting only in a shift of wealth, rather than the reduction or removal of the need for wealth.
