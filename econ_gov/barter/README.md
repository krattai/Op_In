Barter Exchanges
================

Most people are familiar with barter.  Even if the concept hasn't been taught to someone, they understand the idea of trading something to someone, in exchange for something else the other person has.

One of the perceived problems that shows up in traditional barter is that direct barter between only two parties is not always successful.  Comparing value can be a problem and some attempt to barter for what one wants is undesireable if one party can not offer a desirable return good or service.

Modern barter systems utilize some alternative (local) currency as an exchange medium.  In that way, transactions are more like modern commerce, except that the local currency is generally only valuable within a local community, ensuring the economic vitality of the community.  Where current economics often find large, national or international companies attracting the business in small communities, thereby draining an area of it's money resources, a local currency is spent in the community, keeping the money where it keeps the economy active.
