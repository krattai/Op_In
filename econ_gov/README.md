Economy and Government are societal constructs.  They are described systems and methods by which we conduct ourselves between individuals and within groups.

It is the opinion of this writer that regardless of what we think and want, we have systems in place that currently obligate us to behave in a certain way.  We can ignore these things, but must be aware that there are likely consequences to ignoring them.  For example, even if we may personally think that taxes should be abolished, we are still legally bound to report transactions and pay taxes, accordingly.  A choice of ignoring reporting and taxes means the risk of being fined or even jailed.
