Sharing
=======

A phrase began creeping into language in the early and mid 2010's called the "Sharing Economy".  It is, of course, based on the idea that, if someone has something that they don't use on a continuous basis, then making it available for others to share would be valuable.

While that can certainly be the case, sharing is generally based on ultruistic and empathetic act and behaviour.  Turning sharing into a transactional obligation can desensitize that human condition.  It can also lead to abuse as people who do share, risk their property is returned damaged, or not returned at all.

When setting up a sharing based economic system, it should be kept at the forefront that perhaps "sharing" is not the best word to use to describe the transaction and that sharing contains many risks that participants need to remain aware of.  When clear guidelines are set up for this type of transaction based economic systems are introduced, it will go a long way towards benefiting all participants in the system.
