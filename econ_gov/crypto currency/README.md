Crypto Currency
===============

Crypto Currency is a digital, secure, anonymous currency system.

Certain currencies do have a physical analogue, but this is not a requirement.  Physical tokens would require some form of counterfeit protection.

There are many versions of crypto currency, most famously bitcoin, but also litecoin, Dash, and others.
