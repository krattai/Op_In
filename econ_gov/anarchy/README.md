Anarchy
=======

Anarchy is mis-understood as it is used as a replacement word for chaos.  This could be understood as a belief (or suggestion) that without government, there would be chaos.

Anarchy has a primary definition as "without rulers".  As a definition, and as a belief, anarchy does not suggest, nor imply, chaos.  The understanding is, a natural order would result in the absense of government.
