The Market for Liberty
======================

Discussion:
It is possible to accept that The Market for Liberty is a anarchical-capitalist white paper.

The book authors speak early on about human rights.  From a natural systems perspective, no one has rights.  Any organism lives and dies, by their action or non-action in conjunction with the "normal" aging process.

If a person has strong belief in property rights, then this book speaks directly to that belief.

One speaking point could be to the "right" to non-violation.  It is believed by some people, perhaps most, that people do have a "live and let live" propensity.  This does make sense in a natural system, as to at least behave in a way that one would expect to be treated, allows for a non-stressful environment which is beneficial to all.  A certain "moral code" or "code of ethics" is likely to establish fairly early on in any family, tribe, or society.

Also, on the subject of assisting others, or philanthropic behaviour, it can be a tool to subjigate others, whereas it is beneficial for individual human survival to assist others, as the survival of others can assist in the future survival of the individual and ultimately of the species.

So while an individual, by nature, lives and dies on their own self interest and actions, there is no benefit to the individual as a part of the human species, or system, to not assist others.  Similar to how one would protect their offspring or partners from threat, even if that threat may cause the individual's death.  But that becomes an action of "choice", at any given moment.

Then, it is relatively easy to understand how societies and cultures began developing other "rules" or societal norms, which likely became the basis of ideas such as the sacrificing an individual for the good of the community.  But that certainly does not justify sacrificial behaviour by action of a group, over an individual.

Ultimately, many people are likely to accept, at least to some degree, that an individual has a "right" to non-violation and, to a certain extent, to at least a certain amount of property rights, being that which is at least a bare minimum, necessary for survival.

Beyond that, in many ways, the argument could be made that there are no other "rights" for an individual.  Every other "right" could, and should, be negotiated by all interested parties, who would still, at any given time, have a "right" to opt in, or opt out, or at least have the opportunity to re-negotiate at any time.  And this would include negotiating transaction activites, such as commerce, and any associated tools of transaction.
