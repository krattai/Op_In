# Cap'n Proto to Qt Adaptors

This directory contains files which facilitate interoperability between Cap'n Proto and Qt and are not part of the
stake-weighted voting system directly, and may eventually be exported to some other project.

Although Follow My Vote created these files for our voting software, we encourage anyone who finds them useful to use
them in their own projects. We'd appreciate it if you cited us, and also if you sent us a note letting us know they
were helpful!
