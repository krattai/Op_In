/**
 * @brief The BackendWrapper class provides a QML-friendly wrapper for the backend API
 *
 * This class makes all of the Cap'nProto RPC interfaces to the backend friendly to QML. It wraps the
 * functions in Q_INVOKABLE proxies and adapts the return values to Qt types and wraps any interfaces
 * the backend returns with other QML-friendly wrappers.
 *
 * All remote calls return a Promise for the result. If the server returns an error on some call, the result promise
 * will be broken, and supplied with the error. This class takes a connected backend client to begin with, and assumes
 * that this client will always be valid. It is the responsibility of the owner of this BackendWrapper to handle
 * disconnections or other failure conditions of the client. The PromiseWrapper passed to this class's constructor will
 * receive any errors from the backend.
