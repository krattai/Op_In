 * The Promise objects created by PromiseConverter are parented to the PromiseConverter initially, as they must not be
 * deleted prior to resolution; however, once the promise resolves it is set to have JavaScript Ownership so it can be
 * garbage collected by the QML runtime. The Promise remains parented to the converter, so if the QML runtime never
 * garbage collects the Promise, it will be deleted when the PromiseWrapper is deleted.
 *
 * If the promise is broken, the converted Promise will also break. If the converted Promise does not have a rejection
 * handler, the exception will be propagated to the TaskSet provided to the constructor. Either way, the returned
 * Promise will be set to Rejected.
