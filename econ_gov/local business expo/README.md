Local Business Expo
===================

This is an extension of many aspects of Open Communities, while it specifically focuses on local economic exchanges.

The idea of a Local Business Expo is to provide a bazaar like venue where local economic exchanges are encouraged, as well as to highlight valuable goods and services that can be obtained within the local economic region.
