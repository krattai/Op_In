initial experience setting up a local business expo:

++ feedback suggested unclear on name
+ many speakers in same area as vendors
++ certainly without breaks, disrupted attendees from browsing vendors
++ speakers too long, as perceived as challenging or uninteresting topics

Look for an opportunity to leverage relationships with other organizations
