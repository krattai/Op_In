initial experience setting up a local business expo:
+ called event entrepreneurial bazaar
++ feedback suggested unclear on name
+ many speakers in same area as vendors
++ certainly without breaks, disrupted attendees from browsing vendors
++ speakers too long, as perceived as challenging or uninteresting topics
+ vendors fairly eager for $0 fee vendor table rentals
+ speakers fairly eager to present to audience without renumeration

Look for an opportunity to leverage relationships with other organizations
Need to determine demographic

What are the primary structures of these events?
