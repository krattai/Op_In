initial experience setting up a local business expo:
+ called event entrepreneurial bazaar
++ feedback suggested unclear on name
+ many speakers in same area as vendors
++ certainly without breaks, disrupted attendees from browsing vendors
++ speakers too long, as perceived as challenging or uninteresting topics
+ vendors fairly eager for $0 fee vendor table rentals
+ speakers fairly eager to present to audience without renumeration

second event (16/12/10):
+ event in new venue with better a/v
++ that may not be entirely fair, as problem with initial event was missing equipment vs lack of
+ new venue had much more space and great layout for vendors and audience
+ 5 minute elevator pitches worked well along with Q&A
+ break between speakers worked well
+ had great vendor as audience participation
+ more focus on learning by vendors which created more interest of buyers
+ more time to set up and tear down
+ longer event length allowed for more networking

Look for an opportunity to leverage relationships with other organizations
Need to determine demographic

What are the primary structures of these events?
