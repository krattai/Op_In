Local Economic Exchange
=======================

This sub project is being added to open community because it is presumed that the basis of a sustainable and ultimately thriving community is a functional and effective economic transaction system in conjunction with other complimentary aspects.

As this idea possibly has a potential to be developed as an indepent project, it has been given its own repository on github:<br>

In this regard, a Local Economic Exchange (LEE) is a proposal for a system of creating a scalable, functional transaction system designed specifically to provide a least resistance method of conducting transactions.  This leads to a LEE Toolkit (LEET) which would be a guideline for creating a context based LEE wihtin any grouping of individuals or businesses.

A LEET is an open system with the capacity to interchange and utilize any specific tool available for a specific function to compliment the system and create a LEE.  What that means is, a LEE does not have to use a specific currency.  It could use any currency and it could use multiple currencies, what ever works best.  The ability to change out currencies at any given time, based on some change in need or finding a more useful currency, would be entirely feasible and easy to do.

One prominent and often contentious aspect of Economics is valuations.  For many reasons, any good or service is quoted as a government issued value.  It could be argued that such a valuation is arbitrary, although there may be many qualifications and quantifications for suggesting otherwise.  It remains up to the provider and client to agree on such a valuation.

GIven certain considerations, especially that other precious metals are valuable for other uses than that of transactions, silver has been a common metal which has been used for commerce.  With that in mind, 1 troy oz of silver would be an excellent basis as a valuation of 1 hour of general work and by all other things, allow for a simple conversion of any functional currencies in a LEE system.
