Local Economic Exchange
=======================

This sub project is being added to open community because it is presumed that the basis of a sustainable and ultimately thriving community is a functional and effective economic transaction system in conjunction with other complimentary aspects.

In this regard, a Local Economic Exchange (LEE) is a proposal for a system of creating a scalable, functional transaction system designed specifically to provide a least resistance method of conducting transactions.  This leads to a LEE Toolkit (LEET) which would be a guideline for creating a context based LEE wihtin any grouping of individuals or businesses.

A LEET is an open system with the capacity to interchange and utilize any specific tool available for a specific function to compliment the system and create a LEE.  What that means is, a LEE does not have to use a specific currency.  It could use any currency and it could use multiple currencies, what ever works best.  The ability to change out currencies at any given time, based on some change in need or finding a more useful currency, would be entirely feasible and easy to do.
