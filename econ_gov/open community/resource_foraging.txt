Foraging is used loosely as many things listed aren't foraged, but are simply sourced by people who were roaming around and coming across resources of interest.

This document contains known geographical locations where resources, raw materials, goods or services may be found.  Generally nothing listed is free for the taking, except perhaps for vegitation, as most things are considered property which generally has owners.  Still, much of what may be listed is, at the very least, what is often called "farm gate", which means buying resources, goods, or services directly from the farm or resource harvestor, as well as related small, or "mom & pop" businesses.

If a resource is marked as free, please respect property boundaries. Ask permission if necessary. Don't over harvest, don't hoard, leave some for others.
