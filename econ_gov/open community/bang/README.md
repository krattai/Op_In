BANG
====

BANG stands for Barter And Networking Group.  It is an initiative that began in Winnipeg, Manitoba as an informal gathering of people who were interested in barter as a business tool.  For more information about BANG, please reference the BANG meetup https://www.meetup.com/CommunityBANG/ and BANG on facebook https://www.facebook.com/groups/cBANG/ and if you want, you can access .bang on the deep web.

BANG has now grown to appeal to a much broader audience including community development, personal and business training, mentoring, and growth, and more.

BANG now has a .bang top level domain on alternative DNS systems.  If you would like to use it, change the DNS on your computer or device to 184.67.170.30 and 199.101.56.46 as your secondary and you can browse .bang top level domains.  You will also have access all of the openNIC tld peers, as well: https://www.opennic.org/

If you do not know how to change your device's DNS (especially when on your cell network), you can use one of the following DNS Wizards:

_Android_ - DNS Changer (no root 3G/WiFi) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burakgon.dnschanger and please consider supporting the developer of this app by downloading the SetDNS Pro version, and for _iOS_ - DNS Override https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dns-override/id1060830093

To change DNS on your computers / laptops, go into your network settings and change your primary and secondary DNS as listed above.  On your home router, if you prefer this method, change your DNS settings in the LAN -> DHCP area.

Once you have changed your DNS, you can got to the main BANG deep web site http://home.bang and get more information about some of the other resources available there.
