Discussion:
Economics, society, government, civilization, etc are all tied closely together.  Content in the econ_gov path are likely to have similar conent and ideas within them, not least of reasons being that certain ideas are simply what we already believe and / or use, and others are commonly believed to be good ideas that could benefit an economic or governmental system.

The basis for this specific directory is to examine and potentially bring together many of the ideas, design new systems, and potentially provide a framework for others who would like to create their own local, open community or tribe which would be not just sustainable, but would thrive.
