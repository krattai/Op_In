Winnipeg
========

This directory should contain information and reference to the current movement to transition Winnipeg to an open community.

Currently there are a number of organizations that could contribute to an open, Winnipeg community.  These include time banking, barter systems, workers co-ops, food sharing, and community gardens.

A goal would be to provide co-operation between these systems and contribute to a zero resistence between them.
