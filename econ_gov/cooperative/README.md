Cooperative
===========

A co-operative is an business / organization in which members retain at least executive direction of the business as well as generally receiving profit benefits.

There are more distinct co-operatives such as worker co-ops, where the executive consists of those who work at the co-op, and the workers are the beneficiaries of profits.

It is said that regardless of business type, it can most likely be operated as a co-op.

Co-ops often focus on local economies and as such profits (and wages) remain and are used within the area of operations.
