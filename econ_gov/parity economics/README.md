Parity Economics
================

Discussion:
There is a principle that existed in the USA and Canada in the early 1900s of a fair market value for farm produced raw materials.  With cheap food policies already creeping into legislations, the public was being ensured cheap food, while farmers, regardless of advanced technologies, were being excessively squeezed economically, by rising market input costs.

Even with unpopular subsidies being given to certain farms, especially corporation owned farms which argued that it was simply an issue of economies of scale, farming remained, and remains, an unviable operation for the individual, small, family farmer.  The loss of public, or rather individual control of the ability to produce their own food, and make a living doing so, has resulted in continuing claims of scarcity and impossibility of sustainable, small scale farming.  Yet this is an artificial and incorrect intellectual construct.

Farm Parity Economics is a tried and true system which was redacted in the US to the detriment of the US farmers.  Other countries are led to believe that Farm Parity Economics was a failure, and harmful to the GDP in the US, even though data suggests otherwise.

The concept of Farm Parity Economics is sound and can be applied to other industries, as well.

This section is for the discussion of parity economics within the farming sector, and elsewhere.
