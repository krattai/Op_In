    </font>
    <p align="CENTER">Prepared by the National Organization for Raw Materials</p>
    <p><font size="2">Parity is the most confusing word in the English language. 
    The term Parity has been deliberately made confusing, dirty, and ridiculous 
    by all those who thrive through the exploitation of producers</font></p><font size="2">
    <p>Parity means nothing more than balance. Everything has a parity, 
    including the universe. One of the “astronauts,” when asked “How is 
    everything up there in space?” He replied, “Beautiful, everything is at 
    parity,” He added, “all the disparity is here on earth.” What did he mean? 
    He simply meant that all of the problems of man on earth is the direct 
    result of “disparity” and the primary cause of hunger, poverty, wars, and 
    our economic and monetary problems.</p>
    <p>We have a standard of weights and measures -four quarts to the gallon, 
    100 pennies to the dollar, 2,000 pounds to the ton, 16 ounces to the pound. 
    If you buy a gallon of gasoline and only receive three quarts, you only got 
    seventy-five (75 percent) of parity. This mean you were cheated.</p>
    <p>Business and industry has parity. Balance of Payment and Trade has 
    parity. Parity simply means that one sector of the economy must receive a 
    proper price for its production in relationship to prices it must pay others 
    for their production Farmers and ranchers do not establish their production 
    costs. All of these costs as passed on to the producers by the bankers in 
    terms of interest, by governments in the form of real estate taxes. By 
    business, industry and labor in terms of prices they charge farmers and 
    ranchers for all of the goods and services they must purchase from the 
    trades and services.</p>
    <p>Parity agriculture simply means that farmers and ranchers receive prices 
    for their production that will enable them to buy the goods and services 
    that are passed on to them so they can pay for them without being forced to 
    mortgage their farms and ranches to support the jobs and business of all the 
    others.</p>
    <p>Parity simply means the total amount of annual gross income that all 
    rural America must receive from its production to balance payment of trade 
    with urban America. If the flow of annual earned income to Rural America is 
    not in balance with costs it must pay others, then all of Rural America is 
    in a “DISPARITY” situation.</p>
    <p>When rural America is in disparity with metropolitan America, then it 
    means we cannot buy the goods of labor. Then labor becomes unemployed in 
    terms of lost buying power. Then we have unemployment, not from the lack of 
    overproduction, but from under consumption resulting from the lack of buying 
    power to employ the labor. Then business and industry loses business and 
    profits in direct rations to the loss of commerce. Next the unemployed 
    become welfare cases. Federal Welfare programs become necessary to care for 
    the unemployed and welfare.</p>
    <p>Governments soon discover that they cannot balance budgets as result of 
    lost national income which means lost taxes. Then taxes must increase to 
    cover increased government budgets, but nothing ever catches up because the 
    disparity of purchasing power always lags Government deficits and excessive 
    credit increases the money supply without the protection. This triggers 
    inflation. Business, industry and others look for tax loopholes. Then the 
    tax burden becomes heavier for the middle class and lower income groups. 
    This destroys their buying power and the disparity worsens.</p>
    <p>Parity simply means that the nation as a whole earns the income into 
    circulation through honest production times honest prices. Then and only 
    then can the nation provide markets for its labor and production without the 
    necessity of excessive debt expansion which creates illiquidity of banks, 
    business and industry.</p>
    <p>Money like the rain must recycle. Money either gets into circulation by 
    earning from production times honest prices or everyone is forced to go into 
    debt and borrow money into circulation. This is how we have managed to 
    creates a 4,000 Billion Dollar Gross Public and Private Debt. This is why it 
    now takes over $250 billion in interest costs each year to service debt.</p>
    <p>Interest is now the biggest industry in the world and it is going on in 
    the world and it is going to bring about collapse such as the world has 
    never known. Interest to service all debt is greater than the profits and 
    savings of our entire Private Enterprise system. In 1976, we added $362 
    billion to the total gross debt and we couldn’t even re-employ our 
    unemployed. </p>
