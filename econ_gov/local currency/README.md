Local Currency
==============

Local currency is simply a currency that is issued specifically within a local market.  That might be a business, a community, or some larger civic area.

While a local currency is not generally recognized within a country as legal tender, it generally falls under the same legal framework as that of gift cards, voucers, or similar.  It is expected that no person nor business is legally bound to accept a local currency.

The beggest benefit of local currency is, the currency would not otherwise be accepted outside the area of use.  Therefore, the tokens or vouchers that are distributed are spent within the community, ensuring that money does not leave the area, as does traditional money which often flows out of a region, and even country, due to the global nature of large corporations which own a majority of market share in most economic areas.
