Minuto
======

Minuto is a form of scrip or voucher currency, but rather than being an arbitrarily valued denomination (ie. what makes $1 worth "$1"), it is based on time (ie. 1 minute, 30 minutes, 120 minutes).

While there is an academic debate whether one person's minute is equal another person's minute, there is no doubt that one minute is one minute and the voucher is based on a specific individual's minute.  This could lead to the possibility that certain Minuto (such as that issued by non-certified trades people vs certified trades people) may be recognized as having different value.  But that would more be a consideration of the receiver vs the issuer.

The potential for discrepencies in valuation is really a moot point, in many regards.  A minuto is created and issued at the time of purchase and expires at the time of return to issuer.  Therefore if someone has an issuer's minuto, the issuer could "buy back" their minuto with another minuto from a different issuer.

The above description may be a mis-representation and should be corrected as necessary.

The Minuto currency was developed in Germany and as such, the web site is in German.  And english translation via Google exists here:
