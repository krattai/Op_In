The goal of this fork is to create an opportunity to utilize a functional alternative to current, standard money with the functional capabilities of traditional money, and absenting negative aspects of many of the failings of current money.

Some negative aspects of current money called to be:
+ it is debt based
+ it is manipulated through printing (inflation) or destroying (deflation) money
+ the ability to create money is an exclusive purvey of those subjectively entitled

A desirable alternative would be one that would reduce or remove those negative aspects and could also provide additional benefits.

Things that might be beneficial are:
+ ability for anyone to create money
+ ability to create money at the time of transaction
+ removing the inflationary aspects of money

The most likely reality is there will be never be perfect money.  Also, a robust, effective economy could very well necessarily require at least two different currency tools which would complement the entire system which should complement each other as well as be convertible from one to another with zero, or minimal resistance.
