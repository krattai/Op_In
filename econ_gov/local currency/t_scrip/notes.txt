The goal of this fork is to create an opportunity to utilize a functional alternative to current, standard money with the functional capabilities of traditional money, and absenting negative aspects of many of the failings of current money.

Some negative aspects of current money called to be:
+ it is debt based
+ it is manipulated through printing (inflation) or destroying (deflation) money
+ the ability to create money is an exclusive purvey of those subjectively entitled

A desirable alternative would be one that would reduce or remove those negative aspects and could also provide additional benefits.
