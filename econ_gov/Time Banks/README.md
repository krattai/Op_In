Time Banks
==========

Time Banks are economy enabling and revitalization by allowing people to contribute time towards a specific goal or requested service and receive support for their own needs, as time equivalence.

For example, if a hobby farm needs help preparing a seed bed, someone could contribute 8 hours of time preparing the seed bed, and in exchange, the farmer might donate 8 hours back to the individual in the form of lawn mowing or snow clearing.

There can be concerns that one person's service might be "worth" more than another persons hour.  For example, a computer programmer with 15 years of experience might appear to be worth more than a computer programmer with 2 years of experience.  The fundamental leveler here is, one person's hour is equivalent to another person's hour.  If that is not agreeable, then people who feel their hour is worth more would probably do best not to participate.  Some time banks may accomodate for those concerns, where others hold strict to the idea that everyone's time is equal.
