Gifting
=======

Gifting is known by most people as the one time act of permanently providing, a good or service with no economic benefit.  This differs from sharing in that a good or service is used jointly by more than one person during the course of its existence.

For the purpose of economic discussion and currently within the Op_In project, gift and sharing will maintain seperate directories, as sharing can be discussed among many similar or disparate goods, services, systems, and methods.

Gifting is a one way transaction and could include donating, even while donating may bridge to sharing, in the event that a donator may receive a declaration of the donation for tax or other purposes.
