General notes on government and economics

Money is a unit of measure that is agreed upon to enable transaction equivalence

This is necessary because we culturally believe that a pencil is not the same value as a chicken or a house.  Regardless of the logic and math that may be used to prove that case, any value is a perception.  If I have a chicken, but do not know how to convert that chicken to food, then the chicken has no value.  If I have a house, another house is not valuable.

Those statements intentional discount stored or potential value, rather they state only immediate value.  Quantifying and accumulating potential value solves for reducing our fears based on exptected needs and wants.  In that way, an easily converted token of potential value, in the form of money, is what drives our economies.
