General notes on government and economics

Money is a unit of measure that is agreed upon to enable transaction equivalence

This is necessary because we culturally believe that a pencil is not the same value as a chicken or a house.  Regardless of the logic and math that may be used to prove that case, any value is a perception.  If I have a chicken, but do not know how to convert that chicken to food, then the chicken has no value.  If I have a house, another house is not valuable.

Those statements intentionally discount stored or potential value, rather they state only immediate value.  Quantifying and accumulating potential value solves for reducing our fears based on exptected needs and wants.  In that way, an easily converted token of potential value, in the form of money, is what drives our economies.  We believe that if we can accumulate these tokens, then we will have what we need in the future and also may obtain our desires, sometimes expresed as dreams.

If we had no fear of being able to obtain our future needs, and our immediate needs were met without force or friction, then we simply would not need economic and monetary devices.

Government and governance generally revolves around protecting and resolving the fears that our future needs will not be met.
