Land
====

Land and it's use could fall under other categories, and perhaps should, but land is one of those primary resources upon which all activities are conducted and therefore might best be served with it's own area of discussion.

Land is often regarded as the original right and has throughout history, as it continues today, been a primary catalist for war.  It is not just the surface that is desirable, including the flora and fauna and fertility of the soil.  Discussion and desires are what is contained in the depths of the land, such as minerals and hydrocarbons, as well as the water, air and sun exposure on and above the surface.

Perhaps much of the contents of this directory will be regarding property rights which will include open or commons rights, which could be expressed as public domain.
