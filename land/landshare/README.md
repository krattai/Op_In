Landshare
=========

Landshare is perhaps more commonly viewed as garden sharing, although that might limit the scope of what land sharing would otherwise encompass.

Garden Sharing is probably the most simple form of land sharing and for many, it might be the only point of interest.  The ultimate goal is to have access to fresh produce by combining the efforts and resources of those who have land but not the skill or time to manage a garden, and those with the skills and time, but not the land base to have a garden.

A Garden Share is most often a verbal agreement between two parties and there is no need to consider anything other than a property owner having a garden.  It is that simple.  Other forms of land sharing is more complex as it may require the agreements of more than two people, it may require considering land useage, and there could be other local or regional laws which need to be taken into account.

This directory will be used to examine as many areas of land sharing as possible.
